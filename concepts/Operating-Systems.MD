#### Operating Systems
1: What is an Operating Systems?
ans: An Operating Systems is an interface between user and hardware

2: There are two types of Softwares
ans: Application Software and System Software

#### Application Software :
- The software where the operating system can work based on the code written by the humans
#### System Software:
- The software where it provides a platform to run the application softwares is called System Software

flow of Applications
Users --> Application Software --> System Software (Kernel) --> Hardware --> Hardware Components (CPU,Memory,FileSystem,Networking etc..)

Resource Manager:

Process Management (Cpu Cycles)
Memory Management(RAM)
Storage management(File system or external memory management)
Network Management
Security and Memory Protection

Compute
memory
network
storage
filebased


Goals of Operating Systems:
1: Efficiency(Fastness and Latency Throughput) --> Super Computer
2: Convinience(Easy To Use) Windows

there are two types of interfaces:
1: GUI(Grafical User interface) (system call)
2: CUI (Character User Interface) System Command

Batch Processing:
Batch OS: Jobs

##### Process State Diagram(Google.com):
- 1: new --> Created
- 2: Ready --> Schedule/Dispatch
- 3: Running --> Completed
- 4: Terminated

Running --> I/O Request --> Waiting/Blocked --> I/O Completion --> Ready

- 1)New State
- 2)Ready State
- 3)Running State
- 4)Waiting/Blocked State
- 5)Suspend Ready State
- 6)Suspend Wait State
- 7)Terminated state

- You cannot terminate process when runnng state

##### Scheduler:
- Long Term Scheduler
- Short Term Scheduler/Dispatcher
- Medium Term Scheduler

##### There are two kind of processes :
- CPU time : The operatios mostly consuming time at processing side is called cpu bound process
- I/O Time : The operations mostly consuming time at input output side is called I/O time processes
