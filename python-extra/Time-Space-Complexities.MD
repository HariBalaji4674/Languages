## Time and Space Complexities

### What is Time Complexity:
- Rate at which time taken increases with respect to the input size is called Time Complexities
- Time complexity is not equal to time taken
- Time complexity is not dependent on time taken

### Big O Notation O()
- Time Complexities should be measured always with respect to worst case scenario
- Avoid Constant Terms
- Avoid Lower Terms
-
