# Introduction To Algorithims
- What is a Problem ?
- What is an Algorithims:
  - It is an single output with an single inputs hence the algotithim is an sequence of order to be followed to get an output
  - procedure to get output in a sequence order
- Correctness: Inductive Proof
  - Base Case k = 0
  - Inductive Hypotheisis
  - if first k studnets contains match alg return match before i intreview students k+1
  - assume true k = k'
- Efficieincy:
  - Don't measure time instead count fundamental operations
  - assume time complexity measure using time asymptotic analysis
  - How to measure an algoirith is fast amnd speed (Timings how log it takes)
  - it depends on the strength of the computer
  - it deonds on the data you were working
  - it underlying operations is fast
# - How to measure Effieciency of an algorithims
  - Asymptotic Analysis
  - Expect performance instead of time it depends on our input size
  - How we measure performance of an algorithim
    - Big O notation Omega notation Theta notation
    - Big o notation is used for worst case scenarios
    - Omega notations is used lower bound
    - theta notations is used for both the cases
    - mostly in interviews we used only big o notation
# - Couple common functions
    - Linear Size of an Input 0(1)
# - Model of Computation
    - Word RAM (Random Access Memory) in constant time (String of Bits 0's and 1's)
# Data Structures:
- Operate to store lot amount of data
- Representation
- How to store the data in a systematic order
- algorithims to supported

# Interface
- Application Programming Interface
- ADT
- Specification
- What data can store
- what operations are supported
- What they mean

Problems --> Solutions
# We are going to discuss two main Interfaces
- set
- sequence

# Sequence Data Structures
- 2 main ds approach
  - arrays approach
  - pointer based approach

# There are vast Sequential Data Structures
- Sequential Means - Storing elements are stored in a linear and sequentisl order
- Depends on Previous Elements
- Types of Sequential DS
  - Arrays
  - LinkedLists
  - Stacks
  - Queues
  - Strings
  - Deques
