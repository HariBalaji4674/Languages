# Ararys are stored in contiguous locations
# Arrays will store similar data Types
# Each Element has unique Index
# Arrays are not native ds in python
# Numpy Module and Array Module
# Why we need Ararys 
  # for storing colection of variable of same type


# Types of Array:
# One Dimensional and Two Dimensional Array

# One Dimensional: An array with bunch of values having been declared with single index
# a[i] ---> i between 0 and n

# One Dimensional: An array with bunch of values having been declared with double index
# a[i] ---> i,j between 0 and n
